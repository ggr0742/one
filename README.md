# One.com Web Hosting: Affordable Prices, Easy Setup, 24/7 Support

So you're looking for a web host that won't make your head spin or your wallet cry. Fair enough. One.com has been around since 2002—that's over two decades of keeping websites alive, which in internet years is basically ancient history. They're based in Denmark, speak 14 languages, and host over 1.5 million websites across 149 countries.

The whole thing started when Jacob Jensen decided Europe needed simpler web hosting. Fast forward to today, and they're one of the bigger players in the European market, though they happily take US dollars too.

## What Makes One.com Different?

Here's the thing about One.com—they're not trying to be everything to everyone. They focus on making web hosting simple enough that your grandma could probably figure it out (no offense to tech-savvy grandmas out there). Everything runs through one custom control panel instead of the industry-standard cPanel, which sounds limiting until you realize how much easier it makes things for beginners.

They throw in free SSL certificates with every plan, which is nice because Google basically punishes sites without them. Daily backups happen automatically, and they scan for malware 24/7. Their servers claim 99.99% uptime, though they don't actually guarantee it in writing—something to keep in mind if you're running a mission-critical site.

The website builder comes included with all plans, using drag-and-drop templates that work on mobile. Not the fanciest builder out there, but gets the job done for basic sites. WordPress installs with one click on most plans, which saves you from dealing with FTP uploads and database configurations.

## Breaking Down the Plans

One.com keeps things straightforward with four main shared hosting tiers. Each one comes with a free domain for the first year, unlimited email accounts, and that website builder we mentioned.

### Hosting Plans Comparison

| Plan | Monthly Price (First Year) | Renewal Price | Websites | Storage | Key Features |
|------|---------------------------|---------------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Beginner** | $2.49/mo | $4.99/mo | 1 | 50 GB SSD | Perfect for simple sites, free domain, SSL, unlimited bandwidth, Website Builder |
| **Explorer** | $2.99/mo | $5.99/mo | 1 | 100 GB SSD | 1-click WordPress install, all Beginner features, ideal for blogs |
| **Enthusiast** | $4.99/mo | $9.99/mo | 5 | 200 GB SSD | Multiple sites, backup & restore, advanced WordPress tools, great for entrepreneurs |
| **Guru** | $9.99/mo | $19.99/mo | 10 | 500 GB SSD | Maximum sites, premium features, marketing tools included, best value for agencies |

The Beginner plan gives you 50 GB of SSD storage, which sounds modest until you realize most simple websites use maybe 2-3 GB. You get unlimited bandwidth and email accounts too. No WordPress with one click here though—you'll need to install manually or upgrade.

Explorer adds WordPress one-click installation and bumps storage to 100 GB. This is where most bloggers and small business sites land. The extra storage helps if you're planning to post lots of photos or videos.

Enthusiast is their "most popular" option, letting you host up to 5 websites on 200 GB storage. You also get restore capabilities, meaning you can roll back to previous versions if something breaks. Advanced WordPress tools include staging environments and performance optimization.

👉 [Choose Enthusiast Plan](https://www.one.com)

Guru is the top tier—10 websites, 500 GB storage, and they throw in free marketing and security add-ons. Think SEO services, Google Ads campaign management, and enhanced malware protection. Good for agencies managing multiple client sites.

## The Real Talk About Pricing

Here's where it gets interesting. Those attractive prices you see? First-term only. When renewal comes around, prices double in most cases. It's not exactly a secret—they tell you upfront—but it catches people off guard if they're not paying attention.

You also can't pay month-to-month. Minimum commitment is one year, paid upfront. So that $2.49/month Beginner plan actually costs you about $30 for the year, then $60 when you renew. Not outrageous, but something to budget for.

The "free" domain registration works the same way—free for year one, then you pay standard rates. Domain prices at One.com run around $19.99 for popular extensions like .com, which is higher than some registrars but competitive overall.

## Email Hosting Worth Mentioning

One.com shines when it comes to email. Every hosting plan includes unlimited professional email accounts on your domain. Many competitors charge extra for this or limit you to a handful of mailboxes.

The webmail interface is clean and ad-free, with built-in calendar, spam filtering, and virus protection. You can use it through your browser or connect it to Outlook, Gmail, or any other email client via IMAP/SMTP. They even have an AI writing assistant powered by ChatGPT to help compose professional messages.

If you only need email without hosting, they offer standalone email plans starting around $1.99/month. Includes everything except the website hosting part.

## WordPress-Specific Hosting

One.com offers dedicated WordPress plans that come optimized for WordPress performance. These include automatic updates for WordPress core, themes, and plugins (compatibility-tested first), daily backups, vulnerability scanning with auto-patching, and optional CDN for faster loading worldwide.

Managed WordPress starts around $7.99/month and takes care of all the maintenance tasks that most people forget to do until something breaks. Priority support means faster response times when you need help.

The WordPress integration works smoothly. You pick your domain, click install, and within minutes you have a functioning WordPress site ready to customize. Themes and plugins install normally, no restrictions on what you can use.

## VPS and Managed Solutions

For sites outgrowing shared hosting, One.com offers Virtual Private Server (VPS) plans starting at $7.99/month. You get dedicated resources, NVMe SSD storage, choice of Linux or Windows, and full root access for custom configurations.

The catch? VPS requires technical knowledge. You're managing the server yourself, installing your own control panel, configuring security, and handling updates. Not beginner-friendly.

That's where Managed VPS comes in—same power and resources, but One.com handles all the server management. Updates, monitoring, security patches, optimization—all taken care of while you focus on your websites. Starts around $14.99/month.

## Support: The Good and the Meh

Customer support runs 24/7 through live chat and email. No phone support, which bothers some people but honestly, who wants to be on hold anyway?

The chat starts with a bot that tries to filter your issue, then connects you to a human agent. Response times are typically quick—minutes, not hours. Support quality varies by agent, but most users report helpful, patient staff who actually solve problems.

The help center has articles covering common issues, though it's not the most comprehensive documentation out there. Video tutorials walk through basic tasks like domain setup and WordPress installation.

Multiple users specifically praised support agents by name in recent reviews—Humphrey, Ralph, Maximilian, Lesly all got shout-outs for going above and beyond. That's a good sign.

## Website Builder and AI Tools

The included website builder (called Aida) uses AI to help generate starting layouts. You describe your business, answer a few questions, and it creates a basic site structure. Then you customize using drag-and-drop editing.

Over 100 responsive templates cover everything from restaurants to portfolios. The interface is intuitive—click an element, edit it, done. No coding required, though you can add custom code if you know what you're doing.

AI features include content generation through Website Builder GPT and Google Gemini AI integration. These can write product descriptions, blog posts, or page copy based on prompts. Quality is decent for first drafts, though you'll want to edit for personality.

The builder limits you to 5 pages on the basic version, which feels restrictive. Upgrade to Premium ($4.99/month extra) and you can create up to 200 pages.

## eCommerce Capabilities

Want to sell stuff online? One.com's website builder includes an online shop add-on for $15/month. You get unlimited products, inventory management, PayPal and Stripe payment processing, and basic order tracking.

It's fine for small stores—maybe selling handmade goods or consulting services. But if you're building a serious eCommerce operation, you'll quickly bump into limitations. No multi-currency support, limited payment gateways, basic reporting, and no advanced features like abandoned cart recovery or automated email marketing.

For simple selling, it works. For scaling a business, look at WooCommerce on WordPress or dedicated eCommerce platforms.

## Security Features

Every plan includes free SSL certificates through Let's Encrypt, so your site uses HTTPS. They auto-renew, so you don't have to remember to update them.

Daily automated backups save your files, databases, and emails. The basic plans give you backups, but only higher tiers let you restore them yourself. On cheaper plans, you contact support to restore a backup.

Malware scanning runs continuously, checking for infected files or suspicious code. If they find something, they alert you. The free scanning detects threats; removing them requires the paid SiteLock add-on (around $9.99/month).

Domain Lock prevents unauthorized transfers of your domain, which protects against domain hijacking. Two-factor authentication secures your account login.

## Current Promotions and Deals

As of February 2026, One.com occasionally runs promotional campaigns, though they're not as frequent as some competitors. Here's what's worth knowing about their current deals:

The best savings come from choosing annual billing on your first term. That's when you see those attractive starter prices. Some verified promo codes floating around include 25% off certain plans, though availability changes.

Black Friday and holiday periods typically bring bigger discounts—sometimes up to 50% off initial terms. Newsletter subscribers get early access to sales and occasional exclusive codes.

When using a promo code at checkout, enter it in the "voucher code" field during payment. Discounts apply to the first billing term only—renewal prices remain standard.

## Who Should Use One.com?

One.com works great for beginners setting up their first website, small businesses needing simple online presence plus professional email, bloggers wanting easy WordPress setup, freelancers building portfolio sites, and anyone prioritizing ease of use over advanced features.

It's less ideal for high-traffic sites needing guaranteed uptime, developers wanting full control and advanced tools, large eCommerce operations, and sites requiring specialized server configurations.

## The Honest Verdict

One.com isn't trying to compete with enterprise-level hosts or developer-focused platforms. They've carved out a niche serving people who want straightforward, affordable hosting without the complexity.

The control panel won't win design awards, but it makes sense. The prices jump at renewal, but they're still competitive. You don't get every bell and whistle, but you get what matters—reliable hosting, decent speed, solid support, and email that actually works.

If you're building your first site or running a small business that needs a web presence, One.com removes most of the barriers. The free trial period (essentially the 15-day money-back guarantee) gives you time to test drive everything risk-free.

For experienced developers or rapidly scaling startups, you'll probably outgrow it eventually. But for the vast majority of websites—the ones just trying to exist online without drama—One.com handles the basics competently.

## Getting Started

Setting up takes maybe 10 minutes. Choose your plan, register or transfer a domain, create your account, and you're in. The dashboard walks you through initial setup—connecting email, installing WordPress if you want it, or starting with the website builder.

Payment options include major credit cards and PayPal. Everything processes securely, and you get confirmation immediately.

One.com's setup wizard is genuinely beginner-friendly. It doesn't assume you know what DNS records are or how FTP works. Each step explains what it does in plain language.

## Final Thoughts

Look, web hosting doesn't need to be complicated. One.com proves that with their straightforward approach—pick a plan that fits your needs, pay a reasonable price, and get your site online without a computer science degree.

The renewal price increases are the biggest gotcha, but at least they're transparent about it. The lack of phone support might annoy some people, though the live chat usually responds quickly enough. And yes, advanced users will find the simplified control panel limiting.

But for small sites, personal projects, and businesses just establishing an online presence, One.com delivers exactly what it promises—affordable, reliable hosting that just works. Sometimes that's all you need.
